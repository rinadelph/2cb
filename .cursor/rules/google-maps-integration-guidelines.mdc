Google Maps Integration Guidelines
Always wrap Google Maps components with the LoadScript component at the highest possible level where maps are needed. The LoadScript should only be included once per page/route.
Required setup:
Add NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY to your environment variables
Include both "places" and "geometry" libraries when initializing the map
LoadScript should be used in client-side components only (use "use client" directive)
Common pitfalls to avoid:
Don't initialize LoadScript multiple times on the same page
Don't try to access google.maps before the API is loaded
Don't place LoadScript too deep in the component tree
Don't forget to handle loading states while the API initializes
Best practices:
Keep map initialization at the page/layout level
Use environment variables for the API key
Include only the libraries you need to optimize loading time
Consider using useLoadScript hook for more granular control over loading states
This should help maintain consistent Google Maps integration across the project.
